# The-Psychological-Impact-of-Social-Media-on-Mental-Health:

This project investigates the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes, focusing on anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and social comparison. By analyzing a custom database tracking social media usage patterns and mental health indicators of six participants, we explore how different types of content (positive, negative, or neutral) impact mental well-being.

**Key Technologies:**

SQL, Database Design

**Database Structure:**

Participants: Tracks demographics, social media platform usage, and mental health conditions.

Social Media Usage: Records platforms used, hours spent, and interaction levels, linked to participants.

Mental Health Assessment: Captures participant mental health outcomes and connects to both the Participants and Social Media Usage tables.

**Features:**

Designed a relational database to capture complex data on social media use and mental health.

Analyzed correlations between social media habits and mental health outcomes to explore potential areas for intervention.

Developed mock data to simulate participant behaviors and track mental health patterns influenced by social media content.

Goal: To provide insights into the impact of social media on mental health and suggest recommendations for improving well-being based on usage patterns.
